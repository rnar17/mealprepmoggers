Our prioritized list of issues stemming from the issues tab:

1. Maintenence calories can be negative.
2. Docker file not working
3. Daily Caloric Intake doesn't change based on fitness goal
4. Meal prep suggestions are not personalized

The reasons for this prioritization is as follows.

1. This is the highest prioity bug on our list for the reason that a negative maintenance calories simply makes no sense and shouldn't be possible. This isn't a problem with the equation we are using to calculate the calories, rather that the age field has no cap and users are allowed to enter extremely large numbers. Due to this completely unintended behaviour, we have decided this should be our number 1 issue.
2. The docker file not working is due to a couple reasons already stated in our installations.md tab. However, our evaluation group stated that this should have been mentioned more clearly in the README.md file, which our group agrees on, and would be a quick fix.
3. The next two issues are not bugs, but rather a miscommunication between the intended behaviour of our application and what our users expected. The definition of maintenance calories is not the same as daily caloric intake, but rather a set number of calories someone should take in order to maintain their weight. As for 4, meal prep suggestions are actually sorted by calories and prioritize different meals depending on the fitness goal. They were not meant to completely change the types of receipes generated. However, our group has realized that it was our fault that our application's features were not clearly communicated. As another simple fix in documentation, we believe these issues should be ranked last.
